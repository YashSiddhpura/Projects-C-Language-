# Projects-C-Language-
Hello i am Yash Siddhpura. I have developed some projects using C Language.
<br>
<p> 
 Project 1: Mini Scientific Calculator<br> 
 Description: This C program is a mini scientific calculator. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, modulo division along with some advanced operations like finding the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, raising a number to a power, finding the square root, and calculating the reciprocal. The program maintains the previous result throughout the session, allowing users to perform subsequent calculations with it if desired. It presents a menu-based interface for easy interaction and terminates upon the user's request. </p>

 Project 2: Restaurant Billing Software<br>
 Description: This C program is a simple restaurant billing system. It allows users to perform various operations related to generating, saving, and searching invoices for restaurant orders. The program uses structures to represent orders and items, making it easy to manage and manipulate the data, also it uses concept of files for saving the data. It provides a clear and interactive menu-based interface for user interaction. Additionally, it incorporates functions to generate bill headers, bodies, and footers for a neat and organized invoice display. Overall, this program simplifies the process of managing restaurant orders and invoices, making it convenient for both customers and restaurant staff.</p>

 Project 3: Bank Management System<br>
 Description: This C program simulates basic banking operations for a single user's account. It allows the user to perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, as well as to check their account details. The program continues to loop, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.</p>
<br>

 Project 4: Student Management System<br>
 Description: This C program implements a simple Student Management System that allows the user to perform various operations on student records stored in a file. The program uses file handling functions to read from and write to the "student.txt" file. It employs the `fgets` function for reading strings, ensuring proper handling of newline characters and input buffer management. The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to choose different operations until they decide to exit.</p>

 Project 5: Login Screen<br>
 Description: The provided C program is a simple account management system that allows users to create an account, log in, retrieve forgotten account details, change their password, and delete their account. This program is a basic demonstration of handling user accounts and implementing fundamental security practices such as password protection and user validation. It is suitable for educational purposes and as a foundation for more advanced account management systems.</p>
<br>

<p>
 Project 6: Rock Paper Scissors<br>
 Description: The provided C program implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user competes against the computer. This game allows for repeated play until the user decides to exit, providing an engaging way to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.</p>
